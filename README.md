# Digital Transformation Week — Website

Single deployable project containing the DTW main website, the DTW 2026
sponsorship section, and the content API that backs the sponsorship section.

## Layout

```

└── backend/                Express + Prisma content API (own package.json)
```

The frontend is one Vite app producing one `dist/`. The `backend/` folder is a
separate Node service with its own dependencies and its own deployment.

## Routes

| Route                    | What it serves                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                      | Main website landing page                     |
| `/register`              | Registration form                             |
| `/contact`               | Contact page                                  |
| `/partners`              | Partners page                                 |
| `/dbs`                   | Digital Business Summit page                   |
| `/previous-dtws`         | Previous editions                             |
| `/gallery/:year`         | Event gallery for a given year                |
| `/sponsor`               | DTW 2026 sponsorship landing page             |
| `/sponsor/admin`         | Sponsorship content admin (login required)    |
| `/sponsor/admin/:section`| Edit a sponsorship page section               |

To move the sponsorship section to a different path, change `SPONSOR_BASE` in
`src/sponsor/constants/routes.js` and the matching `path` in `src/App.tsx`.

## Theming

The main website is light themed; the sponsorship section is dark themed with
its own document-level styling. `SponsorLayout` puts a `sponsor-page` class on
`<html>` while a `/sponsor` route is mounted, and every sponsorship rule that
would otherwise leak site-wide is scoped under `html.sponsor-page` in
`src/index.css`. Keep new document-level sponsorship styles inside that scope.

## Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build  ->  dist/
npm run lint
npm run preview
```

`src/` is TypeScript and `src/sponsor/` is plain JSX. `allowJs` is enabled in
`tsconfig.app.json` so the TypeScript entry point can import the JSX modules;
the JSX is bundled but not type checked.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

- `VITE_REGISTRATION_SCRIPT_URL` — Google Apps Script endpoint for the main
  site's registration form. See `docs/GOOGLE_SHEETS_REGISTRATION.md`.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` — content API for the sponsorship section. Defaults to
  the hosted backend when unset.

Deployment expects an SPA fallback so client-side routes resolve on refresh;
`vercel.json` provides this on Vercel. On other hosts, rewrite unknown paths to
`/index.html`.

## Backend

Express + Prisma service providing sponsorship content, admin auth, and package
inquiries under `/api`. It has its own `package.json`, so install separately:

```bash
npm run backend:install
npm run backend:dev      # http://localhost:4000
npm run backend:build
npm run backend:start
```

Or run the equivalent scripts from inside `backend/`. Copy
`backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`,
`CORS_ORIGIN`, the admin credentials, and the SendGrid values.

Because the frontend now serves the sponsorship section from the main site's
origin, `CORS_ORIGIN` must include that origin.

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy   # or: npm run prisma:migrate
npm run seed
npm test
```

A `Dockerfile` is included for container deployments.
